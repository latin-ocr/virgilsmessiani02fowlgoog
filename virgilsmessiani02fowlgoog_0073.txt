reference to an actual human child. . . .
The child of whom Virgil sings is the
representative of the new Rome, bearer of
its majesty and power, favoured of the g0dS,
shielded by them from all evil, guided by
them to greatness and empire.” And follow-
ing the phases of the prophetie poem, he
shows that though this child must be
educated to war,1 yet the arts of peace are
his real inheritance: and that in aiming at
the honores which are the summit of a
Roman’s ambition, he is but fulfilling his
mission‚ —the mission of giving lasting
happiness to the world.

These sentences are so full both of
historical and poetical feeling that 1 am
almost tempted to adopt them as a whole ς
and indeed if 1 could understand them to
mean that Virgil was taking some individual
child unknown to usto represent the com·
ing Italian generation and its happiness, 1

¹ Professor Ramsay sees in the puzzliug lines 34-36
(Alter m't tum Tiphys, etc.) an allusion to the Parthian
expedition upon which Antony was about to set out ; and
this seems to me also the simplest and most natural
explanation of them, seeing that the defeat of Parthia
might well seem, at the moment of the peace of
Brundisium, the only thing wanting to the peace os the
world and the hopes of Italy.
