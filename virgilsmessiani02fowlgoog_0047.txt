30 THE MESSIANIC tuen IN VIRGlL

whom Scribonia bore him early in 39 rac· ¹
was a girl, the Julia whose happiness was ᾗ
to be so deeply chequered by her father's
dynastic designs. Scribonia was divorced
lupon the same day, having lost the one
‘⁸ strong claim she might have possessed to
the Emperor's gratitude.1 But Virgil's ·
Eclogue had been already published, and ·
was itseli, as an ante-natal ode must always
be, more concerned with the father than
the child, more indeed with the hopes of
the world than with either father or child.
To cancel the poern later on would have been
r to draw rnen‘s attention to Scribonia's rnis-
sortune and the Emperor's greatest perplexity,
his want of an heir3 it was therefore allowed J
to stand, enigma though it had become.² ζ
Wbo could possibly have foretold the extra· ,
ordinary influence upon the history of the
world with which this wise and gentle silence
was destined to endue the poet? Or that the
authority derived from it would be great

¹ Dio Cassius, xlviii. 34. There can be no doubt that
this is the true interpretation ol the divorce; it was
given first, 1 believe, by Mr Warde F owler in ¹903·
lDr Rothstein pointed out to Skutsch a precise
² parallel,auunfulfilled prophecy (ol an heir to Domitian) ’
· which still survives in Martial (vi. 3).
