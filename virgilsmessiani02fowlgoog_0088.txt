THE LAST FOUR LINES 71

Here there are two difficulties: first, the
old controversy, known to every Virgilian
scholar, whether the smile is that oi the
mother which the child recogniseS, or that
oi the child, by which it owns its love for
the mother. If it is the mother's smile,
then we must read with the MSS, Servius,
and Nonius, in the third line, cui non risere
parentes, in order to make the third line
answer intelligibly to the first: if, on the
other hand, it is the child’s smile, then we
can salely go back upon the earliest reading
which we possess, that quoted by Quintilian,¹
qui non risere parentes, or as it has been
corrected by editorS, “qui non risere parenti.''

For my own part l unhesitatingly adopt the
second alternative; ior not only is the picture
more natural if the smile is the child’s,² but
to my mind it is impossible that Virgil should
not have been thinking of the exquisite

¹ix. 3, 8. Halm, in his critical note, suggests that
Quintilian's copy may have been a “vitiosum exemplar.”
But surely we may trust Quintilian to have been carelul
in such matters.

² l do not know that any one has quoted in this context
the following passage from Suetonius’ Life os Virgr‘l
(ch. iv.) ε “Ferunt infantem (ie. Virgil) ut sit editus neque
vagisse et adeo miti vultu Jirisse ut haud dubiam spem
prosperioris geniturae (zie. horoscope) iarn tum daret.'’
