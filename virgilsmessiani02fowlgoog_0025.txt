60 Incipe, parue puer, risu cognoscere matrem3
matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses.
Incipe, parue puer: cui non risere parentes,
nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est.

Nota—Cui non n'sere parentes. In spite oi Mr
Warde F ovvle1¹s weighty plea (p. 71) sor Quintilian's

balance of authority, in the Mss, in Servius and
Nonius, is on the side os the traditional text3
and Ι prefer its hunc even to Dr Postgate’s hinc.
Quintilian took his reading to mean “Si quis infans
parentibus non adridet.” But is it not less difficult
to believe in the accidental corruption ol C to Q
in Quintilian's copy, than to ascribe to Virgil, in the
climax of such a poem, three such bewildering
lapsas into everyday diction as (ι) the transitive '
use of n'dere3 (2) the meaning “ srnile upon ’' instead
os “ deride ”3 and (3) the change (on which Quintilian
comments) from the plural qui to the singular hunc?
Such solecisms as (2) and (3) occur, of course, in
conversation and careless vriting, as Quintilian and
Scaliger knew ; but Ι am not yet persuaded to find
thern in Virgil.

'l'he conjecture qui non risere parenti removes
only one ol the difficulties and supposes a larger
corruption in Quintilian than the MS. reading of
our passage implies in Quintilian’s textos Virgil.

The translation I have adopted gives the essential
