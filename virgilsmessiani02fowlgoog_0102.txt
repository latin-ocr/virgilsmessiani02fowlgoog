hail the coming Better Age rather than to
salute the expected infant3 and it might
remain, as it has remained, a bone of con-
tention for expositors. This is my own
feeling about the matter; each of us will
judge for himself according to his own
historical and poetical feeling.

Let me end as 1 began, with a· reference
to Mr Mackail’s remarks. 1 cannot agree
'with him that there is no mystery in the
poem at all; but 1 am entirely atone with
him in claiming that it should be treated
essentially as a poem and not merely as a
puzzle, and that it should be interpreted
as far as possible by reference to the poet's

own life and works. As a poem it shouldgt

be learned by heart and meditated on ar
a whole, not merely put upon the dissecting·
board as a corpus vile for criticism.

Professor Skutsch in his book Aur Vergr'l's Frrr'hrer't,
p. 148 fol: cp. his Gallus und Vergil, 127 note, where
he alludes to this essay as independent of his own con·
clusion. On p. 159 oi the former work he points out that
Martial wrote a poem (6.3) to celebrare the birth of a
child ol Domitian, and published it, though the child was
never born.
