7⁶ rus curru or rue posu

of these words, ag. whether the commentator
supposed that at the birth of a child mensa
and lectus were spread for the two deities in
each case, or whether, in a case of a boy’s
birth, Hercules alone had his table, while
in the caseos a girl's Juno alone had her
lectus (in which sense it was understood by
Scaliger); but l have little doubt that in
the custom to which he is alluding, both
deities were concerned at the birth of every
child. For they were the di coniugales ,· they
were the representatives in theold Roman
religion of the male and female principles
respectively: their combined influence had
produced the child. We are now practically
certain that the name Hercules became
attached, we cannot tell how, to the Roman
conception of Genius, and that the corre-
sponding numen of women was called by
the familiar name Juno. The names them·
selues are of no great account, as any one
will understand who is conversant with
the history of the Roman religion; the
numina, the spirits affecting human life, had

the value ol the Scholia first printed by Daniel in 1600,
