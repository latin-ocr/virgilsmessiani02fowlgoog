72 THE CHILD OF THE POEM

passage of Catullus¹ to which all editors
refer or should refer usz

Torquatus, volo, parvulus
Matris e gremio suae
Porrigens teneras manus
Dulce niteat ad patrem
Sernihiante labello.

Ι believe that Quintilian correctly copied his
MS„ which had quinon rasere parentes, and that
the qui became cuiin later copies through a mis·
understanding of the sense and the grammar,
from which Quintilian, who makes it perfectly
clear that he understood the plural quito be
followed grammatically by the singular hunc
ih the next line,² was saved by his good tastu
and poetical feeling. Further, I believe that
Virgil really wrote “qui non risere parentes '’
-not parenti-and I take parentes as the
object of n'sere, understanding itas sorne-
what colloquial Latin, as in PlautuS, Captivi

¹ Catuli. lxi. 216 iol.
¹“ Ex illis enirn ‘qui non risere,’ hic, quern uon

⁵ dignata.” lcannot follow Dr Postgate in his account

of these words (Closs. Rev„ Feb. 1902), nor in his
suggestion of hinc forhunc. Quintilian had just written
Est figura etin numero, vel cum singulam· pluralis
subjungitur. But Dr Postgate contende that Quintilian's
copy of Virgil was a bad one.
