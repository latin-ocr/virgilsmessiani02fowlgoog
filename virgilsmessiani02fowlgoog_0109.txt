told that the inauguration of the Lectistemia
and Supplicationes was due to directions con-
tained in the Sibylline Books (Liv. v. 13,
vii. 27). As these books were only to be
read by the official interpreters, the Quin·
decirnviri,¹ upon the order of the Senate,
and could not be promulgated, after being
read, until the Senate had given their con·

1They seem to have had the assistance of two
officials slrilled in the use of the Greek language: see
Alexandre, Excurrus ad Sibyllina, vol. ii. p. 197.

ermed force: see Cicero’s letters to Lentulus (ad Fam.
i. r, 2, 5) 3 Dio Cass. xxxix. 15. Justin (Apol. i. 44) states
that those who read thern (without permission‚ we may
suppose) were liable to be put to death.

Ἀ synopsis oi these is given by Alexandre, Lc.
pp.198soll.
