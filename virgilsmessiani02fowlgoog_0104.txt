eu Josaprr e. Meron

Tus editors oi Virgil seem content ior the
most part to regard this poem as merely a
hyperbolical expression of the hope that the
agreement made at Brundisium between t
Antony and Octavius in the year 40 ree.
might put an end to the civil striie from which
Rome had so long suffered. The lew who
have made any attempt to account lor the
special features ol the new era loretold by
the poet have usually assumed without prool
that these features were oepable of explanation
out of the commonplaces of Greek or Roman«
literature, there being, in their opinion,
nothing to justify Merivale’s assertion¹ that
“the glowing language in which the reign
of happiness is depicted appropriates almost
every image, and breathes some portion ol
the spirit, ol the Messianic predictions.”
