We go on¹ now to consider the other details
of the new age depioted by Virgil, and, if
possible, to find out where they are taken
from. lt is not necessary to fix on some
one authority to the exclusion of all otherS,
nor need we expect to find perfect consistency.
Virgil is a poet, writing at the most critical
epoch of human history, with a heart and
mind open to all influences3 and in thisy
poem he embodies the half-conscious hopes
and forebodings of his time. The Sibyl
was never supposed to be logical, and Virgil
here makes no attempt to reconcile the rival
claims of Apollo, Saturn and Jupiter, who
are all named as presiding over the new
age.
