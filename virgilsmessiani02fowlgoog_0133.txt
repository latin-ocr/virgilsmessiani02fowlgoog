this phrase of Virgil's, we are not thereby
precluded from recognising in it the social

Î‡ and religious influences of his own time and

country. We cannot forget that the highest
ideal of the Stoics was embodied in the
shape of a human or half-human champion

was believed to have attained to divinity
by his seli-sacrificing labours in behalf of
humanity.

Enisus arces attigit igneas,
Quos inter Augustus recumbens
Purpureo bibit ore nectar.

Even ordinary mortals were honoured as
Lares of the family alter their death, and
the Greek kings of Egypt received divine
honours during their lifetime. Nor was the
astounding thought of another Jupiter to
replace the present ruler of the gods, as he
had replaced his father, one altogether un-
familiar to those who knew the story of
Prometheus, andos the fateful marriage of
Thetis, described by Catullus in a poem
which was certainly in the mind of Virgil
when he wrote this Eclogue. l do not, of
course, mean that Virgil took such stories
