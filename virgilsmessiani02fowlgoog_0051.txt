34 THE MESSIANIC men 'IN VIRGIL

many ol the provinces; a long series of
political murdets, beginning with the Gracchi,
and ending with Caesar and Cicero; five
deliberate, legalised massacres, from the
drum-head court-martial,¹ which sentenced
to death three thousand supposed followers
of Gaius Gracchus, to the second proscrip-
tion dictated by Mark Antony.² Men still
spolie with a shudder⁸ of the butchery of
seven thousand Samnite prisoners in the
hearing of the assembled Senate, and the
boy Virgil would meet many men who had
seen the last act of the struggle with
Spartacus and his army of escaped gladiators
-six thousand prisoners nailed on crosses
along the whole length⁴ ol the busiest road
in Italy, from Rome to Capua. And the
long record oi the oppression of the provinces
year by year under every fresh governor is

year before the F ourth Eclogue, the Bellum Perusinum ;
and alter that, before the Georgics were published, the
naval war with Sextus Pompeius and the final conflict
with Antony.
