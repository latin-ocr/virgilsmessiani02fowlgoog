74 rus curto or rme noun

risere parentes,’' and the resulting false notion
that the smile was the mother’s and not the
child’s. As regards the sense, no doubt it
is harshly expressed: ridere with the accusa-
tive meaning to smile on, and qui followed
by hunc, are between them quite enough to
frighten timid scholars: but where Quintilian
and Scaliger did not hesitate to g0‚ we need=
hardly sear to follow.

But there is a still more serious difficulty
in the last line of all, Nec deus hunc mensa
dea nec dignata mbili est. lt is wonderful
how iar afield interpreters have gone for
explanatione of these words. It has been
thought that Virgil is here alluding to a
passage in the eleventh Odyssey‚1 where
Herakles is described as having joy at the
banquet (mensa) among the deathless gods
and having to wife Hebe ol the lair ankles
(cubile). As Mt Seaton truly says, this
explains nothing at all. Servius has more
than one pompous explanation from Greek
mythology, quite out of keeping with the
true Virgilian tone of the passage: ng.
Hephaestus, being born lame, was not

smiled on by his mother Hera, and had
¹0d. neon.
