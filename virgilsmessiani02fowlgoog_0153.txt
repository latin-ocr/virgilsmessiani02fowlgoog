Ionia would read with interest the announce-
ment in the latest oracle from the East,l that
the conqueror of Croesus was also the destined
instrument in the hand of God for the delivery
of the nations from the yoke of Babylon and
the restoration of the Jews to their native

But how are we to account for the use
of the name Σίβυλλα by Heraclitus in con·

note of Servius on Aen. iii. 445 may help
us here. Discussing the etymology of the

βουλή autem est sententia: ergo Zrssvhhm

Alexandre (pp. 1, 2), where this etymology
is accepted and defended.² lf the word

² Baunack‚ Studien aus dem Gebt'ete der gn'echischen
und anschen Spraclen. i. p. 64, upholds the same
etymology. [It must be confessed that the phonetic
conditions ol this etymology are scarcely defensible from
our present knowledge of the phonetics of any one Greek

appear? Such a contraction would be iar more natural
for Italian, than sor Hellenic lips. On the other hand,
foreign names suffer many things which are grievous

one language. No one can yet say precisely where or
when it was that noluerunt became Pollux, Ὀδυσσεύς
