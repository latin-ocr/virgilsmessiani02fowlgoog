prophecy of an unnamed child was taken by
Virgil from the Sibyl, and in her lips had
been a prediction oi Christ. Pope followed
the tradition of his own church; but even
hissProtestant critic, Samuel Johnson,1does
not seem for a moment to demur.

ln all this, then, we see that the outstanding
reason for the Christian interpretation of the
Eclogue was the lact that the child ινα-ΞΜ

Pope made an interesting contribution to the criticism
of the Eclogue by collecting the six or seven passages in
it, and the Filth Eclogue (which, as we now know, relates
to the deification ol Julius Caesar) in which the poetical
imagery resembles that ol the similar prophecies ol
a regenerated world in lsaiah. Now it is true that
Virgil's snake and lions do not behave quite like
lsaiah's3 true also that similar parallels can be found
without difficulty, as the commentators show, in Greek
and Latin poets; but their combination in one poem
renders at least possible, though perhaps not very
probable, the ingenious theory of Mr Η. W. Garrod
(Clam. Rev, 1904, p. 37), that they were taken by Virgil
from some poern of Pollio's own-since from Josephus it
appears that Pollio had Jewish conperiens, and it is
possible that a Pharisee named Pollio (Josephus, xv. 1. ι)
was actually related to him. The literary problem,
which seems to me distinct from the general question
ol Virgil's attitude towards Messianic doctrine, is
discussed in the third ol these Essays, which demonstrares
the existence of many other links in the chain between
Virgil and Jewish prophecy.
