TRANSLATION

Muses to whom Sicilian shepherds sang,
Teach me a loitier strain. The hazel eopse
And lowly tamarisk will not always please.
If still the wild‚ free woodland note be heard,
Our woodland song must suit a consul's ear. 5

Lo, the last age of Cumae’s seer has come!

Again the great millennial aeon dawns.

Once more the hallowed Maid appears, once more

Kind Saturn reigns, and from high heaven descends
- The firstbornehildl of promise. Do but thou, 10

Pure Goddess, by whose grace on infant eyes

Daylight first breaks, srnile softly on this babe 5

The age oi iron in his time shall cease

And golden generations fill the world.

E'en now thy brother, Lord of Light and Healing, 15
ιο Apollo, rules and ends the older day.

Thy office, Pollio, thine, shall mark the year
Wherein this star begins his glorious course.
Under thy banner all the stains oi ill,

That shame us yet, shall melt away and break 20

The long, long night of universal dread. ⁴
15 For the child’s birthright is the life of godS,

Heroes and gods together he shall know,

And rule a world his sire has blessed with peace.

¹ Noua progenies denotes the expected child who is
to be the first of the new and better generation.
