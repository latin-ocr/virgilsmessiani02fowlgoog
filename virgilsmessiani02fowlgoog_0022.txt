, For thee, lair Child, the lavish Earth shall
spread 25
Thy earliest playthings‚ trailing ivy·wreaths
And lorgloves red and cups of water-lilies,
20 And wild acanthus leaves with sunshine stored.
The goats shall come uncalled, weighed down with
milk,
Nor lions' roar affright the labouring kine. 30
Thy very cradle‚ blossoming lor j0y‚
shall with solt buds caress thy baby lace;
The treacherous snake and deadly herb shall
die,
2 5 And Syrian spilrenaid blow on every bank.

But when thy boyish eyes hegin to read 35
Rome's ancient prowess and thy sire's great story,
Gaining the power to know what manhood is,

Then, league by leagne, the plain without a
sower
Shall ripen into waves ol yellow corny
⁶ On every wild-thorn purple grapes shall cluster‚ 40
And stubborn oalrs yield honey clear as dev.
But in men’s hearts some lingering seed ol ill
E'en yet shall bid thern launch adventurous keels,
And brave the inviolate sea, and wall their towns,
And cut earth's lace with furrows. Then behold 45
Another Tiphys take the helin and steer
Another Argo, manned by chosen souis
Seeking the golden, undiscovered East.
3 5 New wars shall rise, and Troy renewed shall see
Another great Achilles leap to land. 50
