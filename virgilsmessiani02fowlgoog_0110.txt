HERACLITUS ΟΝ THE SIBYL 93

in a different light in the famous
- saying of the great Ephesian philosopher,
Heraclitus, towards the end of the ·sixth
century (te. about the time oi the expulsion
of the Roman kings). ln Fragment xii. of
Bywater’s edition we read the striking words

*Σίβυλλα δὲ μαινομένῳ στόματι ἀγέλαστα καὶ

ἀκαλλώπιστα καὶ ἀμύριστα φθεγγομένη χιλίων
ε’τέων ἐξικνέεται τῇ φωνῇ διὰ τὸν θεόν, “the
Sibyl with irenzied lips uttering things un·

¹ The genitive is used with ἐξικνεῖσθαι by Xenophon,
Anah. iii. 3, 7, ol ἀκοντισταὶ βραχύτερα ἠκόντιζον ἡ ὧι

too short to reach the elingers.” In other passages the
word is better translated “to hit,'’ “to cover.’' The
meaning of Heraclitus would thus be “covers with her
voice a thousand years,” tle. utters truth bearing on lar
distant ages. We may conjecture, however, from Ovid's
“Cumaeos annos '’ quoted above, as well as from other
references, that some understood thern as attributing long
lile to the Sibyl herself, “attains a thousand years.”
