the terrible punishments in store for un·
believers. The bitterness engendered by
persecution solaced itself by imaginations of
the still heavier woes stored up by righteous
vengeance for the persecutors. This, 1 think,
will account for the prevailing tone both oi
the Sibylline passages cited by the Fathers,
and of the body of Sibylline writings which
have corne down to us, though the parallels
which Ι have quoted above show that the
future happiness in store for the righteous was
not left entirely unnoticed. I think, however,
that a careful examination of Virgil's Eclogue
suggests that he rnust have had before him,
if not an actual translation from Isaiah‚ at
least some closer paraphrase oi Messianic
prophecy than we now possess.

Another interesting question is how Hera·
clitus could have spoken so highly oi the
Sibylline Oracles oi his time. Judging from
the parodies in Aristophanes,l as well as
from what are regarded as the most ancient
of the extant oracles‚ we should hardly have

¹ Aristoph. Eq. 61 : Ιδει δὲ χρησμούς· ὁ δὲ γέρων σιβυλλΙᾳ.
The oracles given in ll. 1015, 1030, 1037, etc, are

generally ascribed to Bacis, but we may suppose them
to represent the Sibylline type. Compare also Pax 1095.

See Alexandre, p. 140 foll.
