dating from a hundred years before his time,
which speak of another voice “crying in the
wilderness.’' The prophets, of whom they
tell us, profess to speak in the name of Godr
and under His inspiration. The larger part
of their prophecies consists of threats of judg-
ment They deal with the fate of nations and
of individuals reaching on to the end of time.
They are often confused, apparently self-con·
tradictory, difficult to understand, mixed up
of blessing and cursing in an inexplicable
way. Yet they have been signally successful
in raising the moral standard both in nations
and individuals. ln one point they depart
from the old type as described by Heraclitus.
They appeal to hope as well as to fear ς they
hold out the prospect of a final reign of
righteousness and peace. As to the style in
which these books are written, in so far as the
original Hebrew is concerned, they might be
characterized in a good sense as ἀκαλλώπιστα
καὶ ἀμύριστα ; but, if we think of later Greek
translations, we should have to apply these
words in the same depreciatory sense as that
in which they seem to have been used by
Heraclitus of the Sibylline verses current in

his time.
