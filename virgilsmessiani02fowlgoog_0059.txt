And in the same vision of Anchises we
have the famous description of the duty to
which Rome is called 2¹-

“Others 1 weil believe with finer touch
Shall kindle breath in forms os bronze, and carve
Faces oi marbie' all aglow with lite ;
Others shall plead with greater eloquence,
Make chart os Heaven and teli the rising stars ;
’ But choose thou, son oi Rome, the imperial task
Os ruling peoples3 this shall be thy art,
Show mercy to the humble‚ crush the proud,
And make the nations learn the law of peace.'’

But the fullest embodiment os this con·
ception is in the second half of the Aeneid. ’

The story gives us a dramatic picture of
the ideal ruler in conflict with the concrete
forces of selfishness, passion, and ignor·

suggests turninga wilderness into a garden 3 artes, which
includes philosophie, artistic, and poetic creation as well
as mechanicai inventions: and merendo, which includes
every form oi service rendered to one's iellovrs3 nor can
the golden simplicity oi the whole passage be conveyed
by any translation.

¹ Aen. vi. 847·853.

Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera,- Ι
Credo equidem,-uiuos ducent de marmore uoltus :
Orabunt causas melius, caelique meatus

Describent radio et surgentia sidera dicent:

Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;

Hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem
Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos.
