44 THE MESSIANIC IDEA IN VIRGIL

asan invadet, but as a friend3 no freebooter,
buta pilgrim‚ secking only to execute divine
commands. The war is created by the powers
of evil.

“Mischief, thou art af00t3 take thou what course
thou wilt‚’'

eries Shakspere's Antony, as the mob he
has excited rush off to murder the innocent
Cinna. lt is the same cruel, unscrupulous
passion which Virgil portrays when Juno¹
sends the F ury to incite the Latins to break
faith with AEneas. Mark her commission.

“Thine is the power to embroil kind brothers' hands,
Sink homes in hatred, light the father’s pyre,
And make his freeborn children dread the lash.
Α thousand names, a thousand mischieis thou l
Wake all thy cunning: break their solemn treaty,
Sow slanderous seed that blood may be the harvest,
And fill at once hearts‚ voices, hands with war.’'

To this spirit the brave, patient humanity
oi AEneas is in perpetual contrast. In words

¹ Aen. vii. 335-340.
Tu potes unanimos armare in proelia fratres,
Atque odiis uersare domos, tu uerbera tectis
Funereasque inferre laces. Tibi nomina mille,
Mille nocendi artes: fecundum concute pectus,
Disiice compositam pacem, sere crimina belli3
Arma uelit poscatque simul rapiatque iuventus.
