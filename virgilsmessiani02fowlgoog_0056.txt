anticipation of a spiritual Messiah, when
Virgil declares that Augustus is the deliverer
he celebrates, that Augustus' work is to bring
the great reformationi If Virgil was in the

. end content to accept as the Deliverer a

personality so full of blots‚ can we interpret
seriously his loftier predictions'i But such a
criticism is based on a misconception. Virgil
was not content with the past or present
weaknesses ol the particular human being
called Octavian3 he condemns roundly, as
we have seen, the violent deeds linked with
his earlier career3 what Virgil extols is the
vast service1 which Augustus was visibly
rendering to mankind, and the still higher
service which seemed to lie in the new ideal
of the Empire. ln the passage devoted to
Augustus in Aeneid vi., there is no mention
ol his triumphs in war; his first glory is
the recall of the Golden Age of Justice;²

¹ This conception of service to humanity marks all the
praise ol Augustus in Virgih as Ι have shown elsewhere
(in the Proceedings os tlte Classical A ssocialtbn lor 1906),
and separares it somewhat widely from the tribules ol
Propertius, Tibullus, and even ol Horace ; and by a great
guli lrom the abominable flatteries of Domitian in Martial.
