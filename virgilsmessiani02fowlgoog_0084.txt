at the end oi a purely mystical and religious
poem, to such unguarded realism as we find
in the last four linesi One may well ask,
if the infant is Dionysus and the father
Jupiter, who is the mother whom the child is
to recognise by smiling on heri M. Reinach
confesses that he cannot discover her. She
cannot be Semele: “she can never have

mythological character, for she only appears
in the last four lines and in terms which
would suit any mother. It is best to admit

oi the incest of Zeus with Persephone, has
adopted a tradition, perhaps neo-Orphic in
origin, which made some nymph or other
(une nymphe quelconque) the mother of
Dionysus-Zagreus, or one of the numerous
mortals loved by the chief oi the gods. li

obscure seem to clear themselves up.”¹ Is

these sentences if I had not wished to show

how greatly we are in danger, in these days
oi scientific criticism, of applying wrong
methods which can only lead to absurd
