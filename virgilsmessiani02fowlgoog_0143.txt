and the story of Baucis and Philemon.¹ It
was also in accordance with Jewish belief,
as shown in Isaiah’s use of the name
lmmanuel‚ and in Exodus xxix. 45, Leviticus
xxvi. 11, 12.

ll. 18, 19. “Nullo munuscula cultu tellus
. . . fundet.” So Hesiod (l. 117): καρπὸν
δ’ ἔφερε ζείδωρος ἄρουρα αὐτομάτη πολλόν τε
καὶ ἄφθονον. The same idea is repeated in
lines 29 and 30, and with far more grandeur
in Isaiah xxxv. 1 ε “The wilderness and the
solitary place shall be glad, and the desert
shall rejoice and blossom as the rose,” ibid
lv. 13: “Instead of the thorn shall come
up the fir trec, and instead of the briar shall
come up the myrtle tree.'’ Compare also
sib. Orac. iii. 743-75922

Γῆ γὰρ τογγενέτειρο βροτοῖς δόσει τὸν ἄριστον

καρπὸν ἀπειρέσιον σίτου οἴνου καὶ Quodn,

δένδρεά τ’ἄκροδρύων καρτὸν καὶ πίονα μῆλα
