it quite a different meaning from that claimed
by M. Reinach. In the line Vipereos dentes,
populi incrementa futura} it is used to express
the active power oi the dragon's teeth to
produce a human cr0p3 and so in our
poem it has generally been taken to mean
that the child will actively carry out in his
life the work oi Jupiter.¹

But having settled it that the child is the
son of Jupiter, M. Reinach goes happily on
his way. This son of Jupiter is to rule a
world restored to peace by his father’s virtues:
pacatumque reget patriis vr'rtutr'bus orbem (line
17). Now it was Jupiter who restored the
universe to peace when he conquered the
Titans: and thus, though orbis does not
usually mean the universe,² and though many
Virgilian scholars will take patrois virtutibus

¹ See Dr Mayor below‚pp.111-114and 138. Heyne
explained it as alumnus et num'cr’us, θρέμμα Διὸς, rumperis.
M. Cartault (op. cit, p. 224, note), thoughwithout quoting
Ovid's line, explains Virgil’s words thus: “Jupiter sera
, grandi par la naissance d’un tel enlant.’'

¹ Orbis, as M. Reinach says (p. 373, note), may now
and again be used for mundus (ag. Ov. Fasti, i. 85):
but 1 cannot lor a moment believe that it can have that
meaning here. To me the connexion of Pollio’s consul-
ship with the govemment ol the universe seems simply
grotesque.
