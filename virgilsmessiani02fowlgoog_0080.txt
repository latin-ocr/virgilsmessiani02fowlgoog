with reget rather than with pacatum, what
Virgil means is that the cycle oi events will
recur, and that a new son of Jupiter is to
atrise—a new divine dynasty. This idea,
M. Reinach tells us, Virgil found in the
Orphic poetry and mysteries. This must be
so (so he appears to me to argue), because
he certainly found another idea there, which
is also prominent in the poem - viz. that
of original sin and its purgation: Si qua
manent scelm's vestrisne nostri, Inrita perpetua
solvent formidine terras (lines 13-14). “Les
hommes descendaient des Titans, qui avaient

ils portaient le poids de ce crime et ne
pouvaient s’en affranchir que par l’initiation
aux mysttres.”1 As in this initiation the
worshipper partook of the nature of the
god—became in fact a young Dionysus,
so Virgil prophesies a divine nature ior
his infant-Ille Deum vitam accipiet (line

15). Such verses are cast in the language
of Orphic initiation‚ says M. Reinach‚² and
