Tus SIBYL AND THE COMET 15

Latin word for “child '’ is one that is
masculine in form, namely puem- and hence
it is natural, indeed almost inevitable‚ that
the poet should write as if it were certain
that the child would be a boy. And it is
well to notice now that the lines which
invoke Lucina, the Goddess of Birth, and
the concluding prayer that the mother’s
weary months oi waiting may be happily
ended, make it quite certain (to every reader,
at least, whose sense of humour is not some·
what in abeyance) that it is not of some
mystical moral emblem, but of an actual
mother and child, that we are meant to think.
One of the sacred books of the Roman r
state-religion was a selection of rhymes
and rubrics attributed to an ancient Wise

sight, but Marie Favre, or whatever her name was, took
him ior granted, sex and all—l

To Virgil it would have seemed a discourtesy to the
parents, and more an ill omen, to spealr as ii there
was any doubt oi the sex of the child to be, and it
was clearly essential to the whole scheme ol a poem
which linked a great reformation oi humanity to the
personality ol the child, that the poet should “take lor
granted,” the sex olbis Prince oi peace.

l cannot help hoping that these consideratione may ι 1* “
do something to modily Ptol. Ramsay's strange but re·
iterated belief (see p. 58) that “a poet could not work , ⁸
under such conditions,'’ r'.e., before the child was born.
