Aratus,1 Ovid,² all start with this, descending
to their own generation bya gradual decline
from golden to silver, from silver to brazen‚
from brazen to iton, except that Hesiod
interpolates an age of Heroes between the
brazen and the iron. Still more plainly is
this principle of degeneration expressed by
Horace (Carm. iii. 6. 45)-

Damnosa quid nou imminuit diesi
Aetas parentum peior avis tulit
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem ;

and by Juvenal (xiii. 28)-

Nona aetas oritur peioraque saecula ferri
Temporibus, quorum¹ sceleri non invenit ipsa
Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo.

But, it may be asked, may not this imagina-
tion ola golde'n age in the future be derived .

t from the Stoic doctrine os the periodic renewal

of the world, a παλιγγενεσία or ἀποκατιῑὶστασις8

-“better any age than this.’' Paley even holds that
vv.18o-201 are descriptive os a sixth and still more
degenerate age.

¹ Phaenonuna, 110 foll. Aratus omits the iron age.
¹ Metam. i. 89 soll.

¹ For these words compare Varro ap. Aug. (Σίν. Dei.
xxii. 28, Sext. Emp. adv. Malle. v. 105, Anton. xi. 1.

Both terms were borrowed by Christian writers, see
Acts iii. 21, Matt. xix. 28.
