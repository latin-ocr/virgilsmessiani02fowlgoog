At last, when stronger years heve made thee

11 1
The voaya'ger will cease to vex the eea

Nor ships 01 pinewood longer serve in traffic,
For every huit shall grow in every land.

40 The held shall thrive unharrowed, vines unpruned, 55
And stalwartploughmen leave their oxen 1111.

Wool shall not learn the dyer’s conening art,

But in the meadow, on the ram's own back,

Nature shall give new colours to the fleece,

Solt blushing glow 01 crimson, gold 01 crocus, 60
45 And lainbs be clothed in scarlet as they seed.

‘¹ Run‚ run, ye spindlest On to this fulfilment

Speed the world’s fortune, draw the living thread.”

So heaven's unshaken ordinance declaring

The Sister Fates enthroned together sang. 65

Come then, dear child 01 gods, Jove's mighty heir,
Begin thy high career 3 the hour is sounding.
50 811 how it shakes the vaulted firmament,
Earth and the spreading scas and depth 01 sky!
See, in the dawning 01 a new creation 70
1111 heart 01 all things living throbs with J’oy!
Oh, 11 but 1111 would bring me days enough
55 And breath not all too scant to sing thy deeds,
Not Thracian Orpheus should outdo the strain,
Nor Linus, though his mother aid the one, 7 5
His sire the other, sweet Calliope
And beautiful Apollo, Lord 01 Song.
Nay, even Pan, his own Arcadia judging,
Should, by Arcadia's judgment, own deleat.
