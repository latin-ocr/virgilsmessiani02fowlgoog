THE SlBYL IN VlRGlL 95

on through a thousand years,” for Ovid
records the complaint of the Sibyl who has
s'till to live three hundred years out of the
destined thousand, during which she will con·
tinually dwindle away till nothing remains
but a voice (Met. xiv. 143)-

Voce tamen noster, vocem mihi lata relinquent.

Virgil‚ on the other hand, states that the
oracles were usually written down on leaves‚²
which were liable to be scattered in disorder
by the wind when the door of the cave was
opened‚ and which, when once seattered‚ the
Sibyl took no pains to rearrange. Hence
those who apply to her for advice—

lnconsulti abeunt sedemque odere Sibyllae.

For this reason Helenus warns AEneas to
implore the prophetess to utter the oracles
with her lips, instead os writing them down
(Aen. iii. 448·457). The disordered leaves
were no doubt intended to signify the inoo·

herenee and the sudden transitions of the
oracular books.

Far different frorn this is what Livy tells us
ol the Libri Fatales. lt is of course possible
