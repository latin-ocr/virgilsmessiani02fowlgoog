THE CHILD OF THE POEM

BY W. WARDE F OWLER

Ιτ is now some years since Mt Mackail
, warnadus, in his admirable and suggestive
volume on Latin literature,1 that there is
no great mystery in the Fourth Eclogue,
and that it is in reality only a poem of

nature. “The enchanted light which lingers
over it is hardly distinguishable from that
which saturates the Georgics. . . . It is not
so much a vision oi a golden ageas Nature
herself seen through a medium of strange
gold.” We have been led astray‚ he tells
us, by ancient misconceptions ol its ideas
and imagery3 the Sibylline verses which sug·
gested these “were really but the accidental
grain ol dust round which the crystallisation
of the poem began.”
