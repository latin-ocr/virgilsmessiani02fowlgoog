the action of Augustus in the year 12 rae„
when he succeeded Lepidus as Pontifex
Maximus, and called in all the unauthorized
orades, whether Greek or Latin, which were
in circulation. Suetonius tells us1 that he
destroyed upwards oi two thousand volumeS,

of the Palatine Apollo, thus running, as
Servius says the promise made by AEneas
to the Sibyl of Cumae (Aen. vi. 69 foll).

required even these, since they were getting
illegible from age, to be replaced by new
copieS, made by the priests with their own
hands, in order that no one else might read
them. As the existing copies had been
placed in the Capitol only about sixty years
